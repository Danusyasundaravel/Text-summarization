# Text-summarization

This project demonstrates how to implement text summarization using Python. The project includes a script for summarizing text files using extractive and abstractive methods.

## Project Overview

Text summarization is the process of reducing a text document in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. This project provides an example of extractive and abstractive summarization using natural language processing techniques.

## Repository Structure

- `code/`: Contains the Python script for text summarization.
- `data/`: Includes sample text files for testing the summarization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
